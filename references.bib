author = "Zheng, Dinghai and Tian, Bin",
journal = "Adv. Exp. Med. Biol.",
volume =  825,
pages = "97--127",
abstract = "Almost all eukaryotic pre-mRNAs are processed at the 3' end by the cleavage and polyadenylation (C/P) reaction, which preludes termination of transcription and gives rise to the poly(A) tail of mature mRNA. Genomic studies in recent years have indicated that most eukaryotic mRNA genes have multiple cleavage and polyadenylation sites (pAs), leading to alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) products. APA isoforms generally differ in their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), but can also have different coding sequences (CDSs). APA expands the repertoire of transcripts expressed from the genome, and is highly regulated under various physiological and pathological conditions. Growing lines of evidence have shown that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in regulation of APA. Some RBPs are part of the machinery for C/P; others influence pA choice through binding to adjacent regions. In this chapter, we review cis elements and trans factors involved in C/P, the significance of APA, and increasingly elucidated roles of RBPs in APA regulation. We also discuss analysis of APA using transcriptome-wide techniques as well as molecular biology approaches.",

The entire FS protocol can be performed in ~4.5 hours, is simple to automate and can be easily miniaturized to decrease resource consumption. The FS protocol can also use unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) for molecule counting while displaying reduced strand-invasion artifacts. FS will be especially useful for characterizing gene expression at high resolution across multiple samples.",

Detection of gene fusions and differential expression of known disease-causing transcripts by RNA-seq represent some of the most immediate opportunities. However, it is the diversity of RNA species detected through RNA-seq that holds new promise for the multi-faceted clinical applicability of RNA-based measures, including the potential of extracellular RNAs as non-invasive diagnostic indicators of disease. Ongoing efforts towards the establishment of benchmark standards, assay optimization for clinical conditions and demonstration of assay reproducibility are required to expand the clinical utility of RNA-seq.",

MGD is the authoritative source for biological reference data related to mouse genes, gene functions, phenotypes and mouse models of human disease. MGD is the primary source for official gene, allele, and mouse strain nomenclature based on the guidelines set by the International Committee on Standardized Nomenclature for Mice. MGD's biocuration scientists curate information from the biomedical literature and from large and small datasets contributed directly by investigators. In this report we describe significant enhancements to the content and interfaces at MGD, including (i) improvements in the Multi Genome Viewer for exploring the genomes of multiple mouse strains, (ii) inclusion of many more mouse strains and new mouse strain pages with extended query options and (iii) integration of extensive data about mouse strain variants. We also describe improvements to the efficiency of literature curation processes and the implementation of an information portal focused on mouse models and genes for the study of COVID-19.",
